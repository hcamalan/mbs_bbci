Implementation of Moment-based Synchronization on EEG curves

This is part of the code that I have from my lab rotation at the Neurotechnology group.

To run this code successfully, it is necessary to have python 2 installed (although python 3 should also work just fine outside of print statements), including the usual libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib).

Description of files:

- "archived_functions.py" : self-explanatory
- "functions.py" : functions used in the demonstration
- "Moment Based Synchronization.ipynb" : jupyter notebook file in which everything is demonstrated with plots. There are some unrelated plots that are from the other part of my lab rotation which was written in matlab
- "huseyin_camalan_lab_report.pdf" : pdf file of the work for those who are interested

Other files are irrelevant
